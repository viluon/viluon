I'm Andrew (or, at your option, Ond≈ôej), and I hack on compilers. 

Some thoughts:
- specifications are cool. A machine-readable specification is a specification which itself has a specification.
- I'm surprised I haven't come across compiler combinators, i.e. a DSL for specifying language semantics that lets you automatically derive a compiler. This would be a fun project to work on.
- if you care about (high-level) information, you have to stop throwing it away. This is why I love how [Unison](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison) preserves typed ASTs and why I don't like low-level programming.
- objective complexity should play an important role in design decisions. This is why I consider the UNIX filesystem principle of a unified rooted tree to be cleaner than drive letter assignment and the reason why I don't like languages like C++.
